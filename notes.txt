There are regular users and operators.
An IRC operator (often abbreviated as IRCop or oper) is a user on an IRC network who has privileged access.
IRC operators are charged with the task of enforcing the network's rules, and in many cases, improving the 
network in various areas. The permissions available to an IRC operator vary according to the server software 
in use, and the server's configuration.
IRC operators are divided into local and global operators. The former are limited to the server(s) they have 
specific access to; however, global operators can perform actions affecting all users on the network. In 
order to perform their duties, IRC operators usually have the ability to forcibly disconnect users (Kill), 
ban (K-line or G-line) users, change network routing by disconnecting (squitting) or connecting servers

According the subject our IRCops have specific to channel commands:
    ∗ KICK - Eject a client from the channel 
        Syntax: KICK <channel> <client> :[<message>]

    ∗ INVITE - Invite a client to a channel
        Syntax: INVITE <nickname> <channel>

    ∗ TOPIC - Change or view the channel topic
        Syntax: TOPIC <channel> [<topic>]

    ∗ MODE - Change the channel’s mode:
        · i: Set/remove Invite-only channel
        · t: Set/remove the restrictions of the TOPIC command to channel operators
        · k: Set/remove the channel key (password)
        · o: Give/take channel operator privilege
        · l: Set/remove the user limit to channel
        Syntax:
            MODE <nickname> <flags> (user)
            MODE <channel> <flags> [<args>]

Usuall commands:
    * PASS
        Sets a connection password. This command must be sent before the NICK/USER 
        registration combination. Defined in RFC 1459.
        Syntax: PASS <password>

    * USER
        This command is used at the beginning of a connection to specify the username, 
        hostname, real name and initial user modes of the connecting client. <realname> 
        may contain spaces, and thus must be prefixed with a colon. Defined in RFC 1459, 
        modified in RFC 2812.
        Syntax: 
            USER <username> <hostname> <servername> <realname> (RFC 1459)
            USER <user> <mode> <unused> <realname> (RFC 2812)

    * OPER
        Authenticates a user as an IRC operator on that server/network. Defined in RFC 1459.
        Syntax: OPER <username> <password>

    * JOIN
        Makes the client join the channels in the comma-separated list <channels>, 
        specifying the passwords, if needed, in the comma-separated list <keys>. If the 
        channel(s) do not exist then they will be created. Defined in RFC 1459.
        Syntax: JOIN <channels> [<keys>]

    * QUIT
        Disconnects the user from the server. Defined in RFC 1459.
        Syntax: QUIT [<message>]

    * PRIVMSG
        Sends <message> to <msgtarget>, which is usually a user or channel. Defined in RFC 1459. 
        Syntax: PRIVMSG <msgtarget> :<message>




    IMPORTANT !
    Because of IRC's Scandinavian origin, the characters {}|^ are
   considered to be the lower case equivalents of the characters []\~,
   respectively. This is a critical issue when determining the
   equivalence of two nicknames, or channel names.
